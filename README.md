# Daily Log

A Rails, iOS, and (upcoming) Android app to track my daily habits like exercise, medication, food, and water.

At its core, Daily Log is a Ruby on Rails web application. It uses [Turbo Native](https://masilotti.com/turbo-ios/) to render web content in the mobile apps, "wrapping" the screens in native chrome. This approach unlocks native transitions between screens, native navigation buttons, and modals/sheets for data entry.
